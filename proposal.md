# Proposal

Each governance innovation provides a tool for addressing problems in DAO Governance. 

*Metagovernance* provides a system of secondary incentives to reward governance participants for taking a set of desired actions, which is useful for limiting opportunistic behaviour.

*Hybrid Governance* redistributes voting power among stakeholders using a secondary governance mechanism. The second mechanism provides a system of checks and balances between the two groups, guaranteeing a system can never be captured by a single group of voters operating under a single mechanism.

*Market Governance* decomposes governance into self-contained organisations, allowing market forces to govern each organization's decisions. As a result, organizations that become bureaucracies, or engage in corrupt practices are outcompeted by those that are consistently productive.

These mechanisms improve stakeholder cooperation and alignment using three types of incentives. *Metagovernance* incentives are provided by a mechanism or protocol. *Hybrid Governance* relies on incentives which are provided by other stakeholders or peers. *Market Governance* incentives are provided by the market through competition.

Should governance attack, corruption, or capture be detectable by a governance mechanism, other stakeholders, or competing mechanisms, incentives offer an opportunity to offset the proceeds of these acts, rendering them unprofitable.

Through our investigations in the field of cryptoeconomics, we aim to design a mechanism or collection of mechanisms capable of providing sufficient guarantees about cooperative behaviour in DAOs.

Next, we present an initial exploration of the solution space.

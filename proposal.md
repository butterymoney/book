# Proposal

*We propose cryptoeconomics as a viable solution space for further research*

Each governance innovation provides a solution to an aspect of DAO Governance. 

*Metagovernance* provides a system of secondary incentives to reward or punish governance participants for taking a set of desirable actions.

*Hybrid Governance* redistributes voting power among stakeholders using secondary governance mechanisms to create a system of checks and balances on those who accrue majority power in the primary mechanism.

*Market Governance* decomposes governance into self-contained organisations and leverages market forces to create alignment between each group as a limit on bureaucracy and corruption.

These mechanisms improve stakeholder cooperation and alignment using a system of incentives that originate from three sources. *Metagovernance* incentives are provided by a mechanism or protocol. *Hybrid Governance* creates a system of punishments for corruption, which are provided by other stakeholders or peers. *Market Governance* incentives are provided by the market through competition.

Should governance attack, corruption, or capture be detectable by a governance mechanism, other stakeholders, or competing mechanisms, a set of economic incentives can be designed to offset the proceeds of these acts, rendering them unprofitable.

Through our investigations in the field of cryptoeconomics, we aim to design a mechanism or collection of mechanisms capable of providing sufficient guarantees about cooperative behaviour in DAOs.

Next, we present an initial exploration in this direction.

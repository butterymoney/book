# Problems

## Problem Space

The problem space is defined as DAO Governance, in particular:
- DAO Governance Attacks
- DAO Governance Corruption
- DAO Governance Capture
- DAO Governance Operations

## Properties

- **Stakeholder.** Any individual, collective, or entity that experiences externalities due to the actions of the DAO, e.g. Token-holder, user, delegate, staker/miner, etc.
- **Participant.** Any individual, collective, or entity that participates in governance
- **Preference.** A stakeholder’s subjective comparative evaluations over a range of options, e.g. a miner prefers to increase the block reward, over reducing rewards or keeping rewards constant
- **Objectives.** The goal or set of goals that constitute the DAO’s organizing purpose, e.g. “Buy the constitution”, “Fund Public Goods”
- **Acts.** The set of actions or decisions the DAO’s governance mechanism is able to produce and its stakeholders consider, e.g. Add a new asset as collateral in our lending protocol, remove a particular voter’s voting power, increase token supply, offboard a contributor, suspend the protocol
- **Outcomes.** The set of outcomes the DAO’s governance mechanism is able to achieve through its actions, e.g. Token Price increases or remains stable, protocol users increase

## Dimensions

To measure the effectiveness of a DAO's governance, we consider the following dimensions:

- **Stakeholder Representation.** The distribution of voting power relative to DAO stakeholders, i.e. users, token holders, stakers, liquidity providers, etc.
- **Preference Representation.** The degree to which governance participants are able to express their preferences with respect to the DAO’s objectives, e.g. I do not believe the voting mechanism is legitimate
- **Alignment.** The consistency of a decision when compared to a desired outcome
- **Coherence.** The consistency of a series of decisions when compared to one another, with respect to a desired outcome
- **Legitimacy.** Power granted by governance participants to the governance mechanism through their ongoing implicit agreement to be bound by its decisions

## Problems

### Corruption Problems

#### Opportunism

Where a single stakeholder or group of stakeholders is rewarded for acting in their own self interest while punishing all other stakeholders and producing outcomes that do not align with the DAO’s objectives.

**Example:** Proposing or voting for salary increases or against salary cuts during a budget-cutting exercise.

**Symptoms:**
- Deviation between outcomes and objectives
- Increase in actions or decisions that do not align with objectives
- Illegitimate diversion of funds

#### Capture

Where a minority group of stakeholders possess the power to dictate the DAO’s actions to serve their own preferences while punishing all other stakeholders and producing outcomes that do not align with the DAO’s objectives.

**Example:** Plutocracy, Bureaucracy
- TODO: Add real-world example

**Symptoms:**
- Deviation between outcomes and objectives
- Increase in actions or decisions that do not align with objectives
- Illegitimate diversion of funds

#### Collusion

Where two or more stakeholders or stakeholder groups that operate within or outside the boundaries of the DAO cooperate for their mutual benefit, to the detriment of all other stakeholders and the DAO’s ability to achieve its objectives.

**Example:** [Vote Buying](https://hackingdistributed.com/2018/07/02/on-chain-vote-buying/)
- TODO: Add real-world example

**Symptoms:**
- Deviation between outcomes and objectives
- Increase in actions or decisions that do not align with objectives
- Illegitimate diversion of funds

### Attack Problems

#### Capital Structure Exploitation

Where an individual or group is able to exploit vulnerabilities in the DAO’s governance mechanism to extract capital.

**Example:** Treasury Drain Attacks, Price Manipulation Attacks, Arbitrageurs, etc.
- TODO: Add real-world example

**Symptom:**
- Illegitimate diversion of funds

### Operation Problems

#### Inertia or gridlock

Governance is not able to produce decisions that meet the demands of DAO participants or does not reliably produce decisions that align with the objectives of the DAO.

**Example:** Infighting, voter apathy, failure to achieve quorum
- TODO: Add real-world example

**Symptom:**
- Reduction in actions and decisions that align with objectives

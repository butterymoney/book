# Layer 2 Governance

- Molten is a layer 2 governance protocol for DAOs, enabled by markets in voting derivatives
- It allows multiple forms of governance to co-exist within a one-token, one-vote governance mechanism by:
    - anchoring voting power in existing token-voting mechanisms, Layer-1 Governance
    - providing a mechanism for delegating to meta-governance mechanisms that aggregate participantâ€™s preferences into decisions, Layer-2 Governance
    - introducing a competitive process to vote delegation, i.e. rewarding delegation to outcome-aligned decision mechanisms
- The protocol has three components
    - anchoring governance in L1
    - voting derivatives
    - incentivised governance markets

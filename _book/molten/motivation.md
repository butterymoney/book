# Motivation

## Decentralised Governance

- Governance inherently involves a community coordinating, ***without a centralised actor with privileged rights,*** to make decisions in pursuit of some goal or outcome, and is formalised or defined under set of shared context(s), e.g. a geography, the law, a market, a cause, etc.
- We refer to **decentralized network governance** as the governance of a network (e.g., a blockchain network) through a network (the multiplicity of actors that exert power in continuously changing roles and relationships).
- [Castells’s](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1136) writing on governance notes there are four forms of power related to networks:
    - networking power: *the ability to include and exclude members and thereby control the makeup of the network*
    - network power: *the power that results from the imposition of rules or standards required to coordinate interactions within the network*
    - networked power: *the power that actors have over one another within the network*
    - network-making power: *****************************************the power of an actor or organisation to constitute or reprogram a network according to its values and specific interests*****************************************
- In decentralised governance systems, many of today’s problems cluster around optimising the distribution of governance power of a decentralised system to increase the system’s probability of success

## Decentralised Governance Models

### **Direct Democracy → One token, one vote on every proposal**

**Description**

- In a direct democracy, token-holders make decisions by voting on proposals, where each token is equivalent to a vote
- Governance must configure the following parameters:
    - Who has the right to create a proposal
    - How to convert token votes to a decision, e.g. majority-rule, supermajority, quorum-contingent

**Benefits**

- bundling financial upside and governance rights aligns risk and responsibility which incentivises those with the most to gain from price appreciation to make decisions that directly or indirectly maximise price appreciation
- this is a copy of the equity system which makes it easy-to-understand → fork of equity

**Limitations**

- keeps out those who may be affected by governance but don’t have the capital to acquire governance rights
- tends towards plutocracy which if left unchecked leads to failure → “number go up” only regardless of negative externalities

### **Representative democracy → One token, one vote on every proposal with vote delegation**

**Description**

- In a representative democracy, token-holders make decisions by voting on proposals, where each token is equivalent to a vote, but can also delegate their voting power to a representative
- Governance must configure the following parameters:
    - Who has the right to create a proposal
    - How to convert token votes to a decision, e.g. majority-rule, supermajority, quorum-contingent
    - Which rights can be delegated and to who

**Benefits**

- aligns incentives by unbundling financial risk and governance power and allocating them to domain experts
- allows governance rights to accrue to representatives voters believe are best placed to represent their preferences
- reduces voter apathy

**Limitations**

- as delegation scales, the nuance of voter preferences is diluted to the preferences of a smaller subset of voters, i.e. the delegates, which is less representative of the population
- forces the voter to find a single delegate who represents their entire range of preferences across all possible decisions (though tokens could be split across wallets or delegation functionality enhanced)
- allowing voters to delegate enables a more persistent form of voter apathy, as seen in our traditional political system

### **Reputation voting → One person, one vote OR One contribution/reputation unit, one vote on every proposal**

**Description**

- Non-transferable voting based on your membership, reputation and, or contribution

**Benefits**

- more equitable
- aligns contribution and power
- not vulnerable to plutocracy

**Limitations**

- only as performant as the system’s ability to measure contributions and assign relative value
- assumes equal exposure to externalities
- inability to express preference intensity

### **Republic-like DAOs → One token, one vote on team appointment proposals**

**Description**

- Vote in teams to run governance and operations

**Benefits**

- the governance surface area is bounded and therefore simpler to understand and reason about
- increase in voter participation

**Limitations**

- principal-agent incentive alignment problem
- increased bureaucracy / opportunism risk
- system is only as performant as its observability

# Opportunity

- Each decentralised governance model introduces a trade-off between incentive alignment and stakeholder representation
- Governance mechanisms tend to be hard-coded or centrally-planned and implemented unilaterally, rendering them costly to design, deploy, and subsequently update, which means power often accrues to those with the ability to update governance, i.e. network-making powers
- A market-based approach to the allocation of governance power to competing governance mechanisms improves the aggregate governance mechanism’s ability to adapt to the dynamic power relationships between stakeholders
- By moving away from unipolar governance mechanisms towards market-based multipolar governance mechanisms, we can build organisations that continuously adapt to a changing environment

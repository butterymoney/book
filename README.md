# ðŸ§ˆ Butter

Butter is a DAO governance system. Its objective is to align DAO governance outcomes to DAO objectives through the direct application of incentives.

This paper describes a prototype, Molten, that attempts to influence DAO stakeholders and governance participants to cooperate using one-off payments.

# Summary

One token, one vote mechanisms are the most popular governance mechanisms used by DAOs. However, one token, one vote and other token voting systems are plutocracies and widely considered vulnerable to [corruption](./problems.md#corruption-problems) and [attack](./problems.md#attack-problems).

Large or mature DAOs, and many newer DAOs, have introduced vote delegation in an attempt to scale governance and alleviate the risks of plutocracy.

However, many recent and well-known examples of plutocracy involve DAOs, including ENS DAO, Sushi DAO, and MakerDAO, in which vote delegation is allowed and often enforced.

We examine the DAO governance problem space and highlight promising in-market solutions, including hybrid governance, metagovernance, and market-based governance.

We propose cryptoeconomics, a system of economic incentives designed to produce behaviours in a micro environment that create desirable, emergent properties in a macro environment, as a viable solution space for further research and define a system that seeks to prove improve stakeholder cooperation in DAO Governance through incentives designed to make corruption an unprofitable strategy.

Welcome to Butter.

# Summary

One token, one vote mechanisms are the primary governance mechanism used by DAOs. However, one token, one vote and other token voting governance systems operate as effective plutocracies and are widely considered vulnerable to corruption, where corruption is a decision or action that diverts rewards to a single stakeholder or stakeholder group and results in negative payoffs for all other stakeholders, and attack, where an individual or collective uses the governance mechanism to conduct malicious acts.

Large or mature DAOs, and many newer DAOs, introduced vote delegation in an attempt to scale governance, mitigate voter apathy, and alleviate the risks of plutocracy.

However, the most recent and well-known examples of plutocracy are from DAOs, including ENS DAO, Sushi DAO, and MakerDAO, in which vote delegation is enabled and sometimes mandatory.

We examine the DAO governance problem space and highlight promising in-market solutions, including hybrid governance and metagovernance. We then propose crypteconomics as a viable solution space.

Finally, we propose a solution to limit corruption and improve stakeholder cooperation using a system of meta-incentives, i.e. rewards or punishments for incentive-giving, to render corruption an unprofitable strategy.

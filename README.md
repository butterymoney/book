Welcome to Butter.

# Summary

One token, one vote mechanisms are the primary governance mechanism used by DAOs. However, one token, one vote and other token voting governance systems operate as effective plutocracies and are widely considered vulnerable to [corruption](/problems.md#corruption-problems) and [attack](/problems.md#attack-problems).

Large or mature DAOs, and many newer DAOs, have introduced vote delegation in an attempt to scale governance, mitigate voter apathy, and alleviate the risks of plutocracy.

However, the most recent and well-known examples of plutocracy are from DAOs, including ENS DAO, Sushi DAO, and MakerDAO, in which vote delegation is enabled and sometimes mandatory.

We examine the DAO governance problem space and highlight promising in-market solutions, including hybrid governance, metagovernance, and market-based governance.

We propose cryptoeconomics as a viable solution space for further research and present a prototype that seeks to improve stakeholder cooperation in DAO Governance through incentives designed to make corruption an unprofitable strategy.

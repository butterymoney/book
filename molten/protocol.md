# Metagovernance Protocol

- Molten is a metagovernance protocol for DAOs. The protocol increases the throughput and efficacy of DAO governance by nesting multiple forms of governance within a one-token, one-vote governance mechanism. The mechanism:
    - anchors voting power in an existing token-voting mechanism
    - provides a mechanism for delegating to meta-governance mechanisms that aggregate participantâ€™s preferences into decisions
    - introduces a competitive process to vote delegation, i.e. rewarding delegation to outcome-aligned decision mechanisms

The protocol has three components:

- molten DAOs (actuator)
    - proposers observe DAOs for profitable governance opportunities
    - proposers set molten DAO purpose, maturity, and target DAO
    - proposers encode governance in molten DAOs, e.g. vetocracy
- L1 staking (sensor)
    - DAO tokenholders and speculators observe molten DAOs for opportunities
    - DAO tokenholders stake parent DAO tokens in molten DAOs
    - DAO tokenholders receive molten DAO tokens
- Molten Token (actuator)
    - token emissions issued to molten token holders & proposers based on relative % of token supply locked, e.g. 5% of AAVE staked versus 15% of all MKR staked = 75% of token emissions distributed to mMKR holders

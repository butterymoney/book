# Layer 2 Governance

Molten is a layer 2 governance protocol for DAOs. The protocol increases the throughput and efficacy of DAO governance by nesting multiple forms of governance within a one-token, one-vote governance mechanism by:

- anchoring voting power in existing token-voting mechanisms, Layer 1 Governance
- providing a mechanism for delegating to meta-governance mechanisms that aggregate participantâ€™s preferences into decisions, Layer 2 Governance
- introducing a competitive process to vote delegation, i.e. rewarding delegation to outcome-aligned decision mechanisms

The protocol has three components:

- molten DAOs (actuator)
    - proposers observe DAOs for profitable governance opportunities
    - proposers set molten DAO purpose, maturity, and target DAO
    - proposers encode governance in molten DAOs, e.g. vetocracy
- L1 staking (sensor)
    - DAO tokenholders and speculators observe moltenDAOs for opportunities
    - liquidity providers stake molten DAOs with parent DAO tokens
    - liquidity providers receive molten DAO tokens
- Molten Token (actuator)
    - token emissions issued to molten token holders & proposers based on relative % of token supply locked, e.g. 5% of AAVE staked versus 15% of all MKR staked = 75% of token emissions distributed to mMKR holders

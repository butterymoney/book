TODO: Propose crypteconomics as a viable solution space

The ideal decentralised governance model in any circumstance is unlikely to be one where voting power is derived entirely from purchasing tokens, being elected, attaining membership, providing labour, or building reputation.

Instead we expect decentralised governance to be adaptive to the needs of the organisation over time, comprising and rebalancing elements of each governance model in response to the needs of its users.

DAOs, unfortunately, are constrained by their adherence to a single governance mechanism at any one time which are often hard-coded and implemented unilaterally, rendering them expensive to change.

Selecting a DAO governance model typically involves a trade off between incentive alignment, stakeholder representation, and efficacy.

This tradeoff can be seen at work in MakerDAO, where governance produced increasingly bureaucratic outcomes as the action space of the DAO’s agents grew beyond the control of MakerDAO’s governance mechanisms.

The solution proposed by Rune in Endgame is a decomposition of Maker into a single core DAO comprising the main functions of the Maker protocol and a collection of smaller “MetaDAO” governance units with their own governance and governance token. Implementing MakerDAO’s governance decomposition (or mitosis) as a single change is expensive and carries significant risk for the DAO’s stakeholders, who have limited proof that the new governance mechanism will perform as expected.

We posit that DAO governance can be adapted progressively using a market-driven process of governance decomposition and recomposition, where a single token vote can house any number of sub-mechanisms. Within a single token, therefore, multiple governance mechanisms can co-exist, and compete—allowing the limitations of one mechanism to be offset by the benefits of another.

A market-based approach to the allocation of governance power to competing governance mechanisms improves the aggregate governance mechanism’s ability to adapt to the dynamic power relationships between stakeholders and remain fit to the preferences of its stakeholders.

By moving away from unipolar governance mechanisms towards market-based multipolar governance mechanisms, we can build organisations that can:

- continuously adapt to a changing environment, i.e. gridlock or inertia
- allow governance participants to express preferences and opinions that cannot be captured by one token, one vote governance mechanisms, i.e. bundling or scaling
- continuously produce counter-balancing incentives that limit the risk of governance capture by a single voting bloc, i.e. centralisation or capture
